            Five years after competing in the World Grand Prix, Lightning McQueen, now a seven-time Piston Cup champion, finds himself overshadowed by Jackson Storm, a rookie who is part of a new generation of racers who use the latest technology to improve their performance.
            As Storm's success progresses throughout the season and attracts other rookies, most of the veterans either retire or are dismissed by their sponsors.
            In the final race of the season at Los Angeles, Lightning starts falling behind Storm after both of them pitted.
            He tries to keep up, but in doing so blows a tire and suffers a violent crash, leaving him badly injured and ending his worst season on record prematurely, while Storm goes on to win the Piston Cup.
